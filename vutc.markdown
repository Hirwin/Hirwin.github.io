VUTC is the Tech Crew at Villanova University. It is 100% Student run, with an executive board that has full autonomy from the advisor. When I left VUTC had an annual revenue of over $150k. VUTC works all events from doing audio for small Acapella concerts, to full professional scale concerts for large headliners such as Twenty One Pilots and Wiz Khalifa.

In my time at Villanova, I held a position on the Executive board of Tech Crew for all four years, initially just as the Web Developer, but then 'Events Manager' was appended to my duties as well.

Events Manager
----
Much of my time spent as the Events manager was email correspondence with clients, mostly clubs on campus in need of our services. 
The event to event tasks included creating equipment plans for each event, making sure venues were booked properly, handling power drops from maintenance when we needed 3-phase power for some of our larger events. I also was the liaison between Tech Crew and any guest musician/band that would be coming, so we could meet any technical needs.

Along with these specific role tasks, I also was a ranking member of the executive board, meaning I headed meetings involving our largest scale events and was a spokesperson for VUTC when we had meetings with other organizations such as the President of the Universities Office, or the Office of Alumni.

Web Developer

As a freshman I was asked to learn web development, and then take control of the mess that was the original website. It had been made in 2004, and the current year was 2015, so it was certainly a bit dated (and passwords were saved in plain text). I worked on it with the assistance of the Vice President at the time, an Electrical Engineer who had slightly more HTML/SQL/PHP experience than I did. Together we completely overhauled functionality, and UI/UX. When I took on the position of Events Manager, in order to better delegate tasks, I created the Web Development team that I oversaw.  

The New Dashboard for workers supplied information about their events and open positions on upcoming events as well as some other general information like notifications and monthly event count tracking. We also implemented a barcode scanning system to maintain our equipment inventory. This was both to handle the possibility of forgetting equipment, as well as to track equpiment in need of repairs. This system also led to the creation of an event planning system that would pull equipment from an unused list to avoid events on the same day requiring the same equipment.

The improved website saw many new clients requesting quotes as the system was much easier and streamlines for clients.
