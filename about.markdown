In my time spent at Alation I worked with both the Sales Engineering and Software Engineering teams.
This allowed me to explore of a lot of what Alation had to offer both as a service and as a company.

Sales Engineering
------
- While working with the Sales Engineering team my first task was to clean up their file systems as they had transitioned from small startup to slightly less small startup. Private google drives were still being transitioned out. In an effort to create a more accessible unified file system, I wrote a script in the google scripting language to scrape all of the file systems recursively, and create a formatted google sheet that was easily searchable and linked to all pertinent files. This led to many of the other teams requesting similar reformattings of their file systems as they were similar in scope and in a lack of usability.  

- My major project for the Sales team was creating a demo environment for use during sales pitches as well as training sessions with the product. Alation is all about looking at a lot of data, and empowering actions with this data. So the natural crossover for my need of big data, and something I could effectively empower with queries was comic book sales over the last 25 years. After scrapping well over 100,000 data points and establishing a SQL server DB for them, I created some example queries to populate the Alation demo. These ranged from sales comparisons overall for larger companies such as DC and Marvel, to comparisons of comic volume to profit as well as more minute analysis of event impacts on sales such as comic book movies being released.


Software Engineering
------
While working with the Software engineering team, I spent my time focused on two major projects.  
- The first was assisting in the updating of legacy code to meet ES6 standards.  
- The second was helping develop bug fixes within the Curation portion of the product. Before this internship I had only a loose familiarity with React and the stack as a whole, so I really used a lot of this time to paircode and learn from the engineers while tackling any and all bugs to be able to understand and learn as much as I could in the short time I had.
